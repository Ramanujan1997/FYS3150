# FYS4150

This repository contains the works of Ivar Svalheim Haugerud and Cecilie Glittum related to the course [FYS4150 Computational Physics](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS4150/) at the University of Oslo.


##  Project 1: Solving the 1D Poisson equation 

In project 1, we solved the one dimensional Poisson equation. The code is found in the directory [project1](https://github.uio.no/cecilgl/FYS4150/tree/master/project1).


## Project 2: Eigenvalue problems in physics - Solving the Schrödinger equation

In project 2, we solve two types of eigenvalue problems; the buckling beam and the Schrödinger equation for quantum dots. The code is found in the directory [project2](https://github.uio.no/cecilgl/FYS4150/tree/master/project2).

## Project 3: The Solar System

In project 3, we solve coupled differential equations for the solar system. We have written a general code for n bodies where you have the possibilities of keeping the sun at rest, include the movement of the sun and include relativistic corrections to the acceleration. The simulations use an included data file containing the positions and velocities of a wide range of objects in the Solar System. The positions and velocities are dated 2018-Sep-28 00:00:00.0000 TDB and extracted from [NASAs JPL HORIZONS](http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#top). All the code for simulating the Solar System is found in the directory [project3](https://github.uio.no/cecilgl/FYS4150/tree/master/project3).


## Project 4: The 2D Ising model

In project 4, we solve the 2D Ising model using Monte Carlo simulations and the Metropolis algorithm. The code is found in the directory [project4](https://github.uio.no/cecilgl/FYS4150/tree/master/project4).

## Project 5: Variational Monte Carlo of electrons in a quantum dot

In project 5, we use variational Monte Carlo to approximate the ground state energy of to interacting electrons in a quantum dot. The code is found in the directory [project5](https://github.uio.no/cecilgl/FYS4150/tree/master/project5).
